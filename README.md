Supply Chain Tracking System
Project Description
A blockchain-based supply chain tracking system that allows manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers to track products throughout their lifecycle. This system ensures transparency, authenticity, and accountability in the supply chain by recording every transaction and transfer of ownership on the blockchain.
Project Vision
To create a decentralized solution that eliminates counterfeiting, reduces fraud, and builds trust among all stakeholders in a supply chain. By providing immutable records of product journeys from manufacturing to end consumers, we aim to enhance transparency and efficiency in global supply chains.
Key Features

Product Registration: Manufacturers can register new products with unique identifiers
Ownership Transfer: Record transfer of products between different supply chain participants
Product History: Track the complete journey of a product through the supply chain
Verification System: Verify authenticity of products at any point in the supply chain
Role-Based Access: Different access levels for manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers

Future Scope

Integration with IoT devices for automated tracking and monitoring
Implementing QR code scanning for easy product verification by consumers
Adding temperature and condition monitoring for perishable goods
Developing a mobile application for end-users to access product information
Creating a marketplace feature for direct producer-to-consumer sales
